# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please do **not** open a public issue. Instead, report it privately by emailing:

- christian.abele@uni-bielefeld.de

Please include as much detail as possible so I can quickly address the issue. I aim to respond to all security reports within 7 days.

## Security Best Practices
- Always use the latest version of CausalPilot.
- Review dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
- Do not share sensitive data in public issues or discussions.

## Disclosure Policy
I will coordinate with the reporter to validate and address the vulnerability. Once resolved, I will publish a security advisory and credit the reporter (if desired).
